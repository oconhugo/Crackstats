# CrackStats
Repository for CrackStats

## Introduction
The mobile application provides a system to manage soccer leagues. Each player, team owner or league owner needs to create a profile, which includes a password that is encrypted by the system. The profile will have stored the user information, stats, teams, leagues and administrative permissions. The system is self-sustainable, each player requests permission to be added to the team, which is accepted/rejected by the team owner and in the same manner, each time a team wants to be created, it requests permission to a league to be added to it. Leagues are created by application admins. All the information (stats, schedule, team, players, data, etc) is stored in a database.

## Description
### Context
We have participated and continue to do so in several soccer leagues, and found a problem at the administration and management of them. We Found that those amateurs soccer leagues could have a application to assist them on the administration and organization duties. Usually, local leagues use social media to administrate their leagues and update their schedule, stats, and standings, all data obtained and updated manually.
We created this app to help those local leagues to administrate their tournament in a way where they can significally reduce the user input and effort required. This app will help the league as well as the user, as information, stats and updates will be available quicker, with a more user friendly UI.

### What can the project specifically do
From the user side, this application can store his perfomances from each game, helping the player to keep track of his personal stats as goal scored, matches played, and diciplinary stats. It facilitates the way they register to the league and to a particular team by just sending a request to the owner of the team/league administrator. Also, announcements are easily transmitted. The app requires to create a password(encrypted for security) to access the player profile.
For the administrators, this applications updates the stadistics, schedule, player information and team information. Get rid of the paper work and manual work. Crackstats also include a notifications section, where the administrators can easily pass information to everyone one a team/leangue.
